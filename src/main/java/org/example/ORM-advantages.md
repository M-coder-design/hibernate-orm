Why ORM Over Native JDBC?
Challenges in Native JDBC
Boilerplate Code:

Writing and managing repetitive JDBC code (e.g., handling Connection, Statement, ResultSet).
Manual mapping of query results to Java objects.
Complex Queries:

Managing joins and relationships between tables in SQL is cumbersome.
Error-Prone:

Hard to maintain and prone to errors like connection leaks.
Object Mapping:

Manual conversion of database rows into Java objects.
Advantages of ORM
Simplified Development:

Automatically maps tables to classes and rows to objects.
No need to write SQL for basic operations like CRUD.
Readable Code:

Operations like saving an object to the database are as simple as calling session.save().
Relationship Management:

Manages relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) using annotations or XML configurations.
Transaction Management:

Integrated with frameworks like Spring for seamless transaction handling.
Query Abstraction:

Provides query languages like HQL (Hibernate Query Language) or Criteria API to write database queries using Java objects.
