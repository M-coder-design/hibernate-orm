1. public class HibernateUtil {
   Explanation:
   This declares a class named HibernateUtil. The class serves as a utility class for configuring Hibernate and managing the SessionFactory.
   Why:
   This is a common pattern used in Hibernate applications. Instead of repeatedly creating and configuring Hibernate's SessionFactory in multiple parts of your application, you centralize this logic into a utility class, making your code more organized and easier to maintain.
2. private static SessionFactory sessionFactory;
   Explanation:
   This declares a private static variable of type SessionFactory. SessionFactory is a factory that produces Session objects (used for interacting with the database).
   Why:
   It’s static because you want to share the same SessionFactory across the entire application (since creating a SessionFactory is expensive). It’s private to encapsulate and protect access to the SessionFactory from other parts of the application.
3. static {
   Explanation:
   This is a static initializer block. This block of code will execute when the class is first loaded into memory.
   Why:
   The SessionFactory needs to be initialized only once when the application starts, so the static block ensures that this happens when the class is loaded. This is crucial because the SessionFactory is a heavy object to create, and it's a good practice to create it only once.
4. try {
   Explanation:
   This starts a try block to handle exceptions. The code inside the block is attempting to configure and build the Hibernate SessionFactory.
   Why:
   Building the SessionFactory can throw exceptions (e.g., misconfigured database connection, missing Hibernate configuration files, etc.), so the try block is used to catch and handle any of those errors.
5. Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
   Explanation:
   Here, a new Configuration object is instantiated. The Configuration class is used to configure Hibernate settings and map your Java classes to database tables.
   Why:
   This object will hold all the Hibernate configuration settings (such as database connection properties, entity classes, etc.). It’s the starting point for configuring Hibernate programmatically.
6. Setting Hibernate properties:
   java
   Copy code
   configuration.setProperty("hibernate.connection.driver_class", "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
   configuration.setProperty("hibernate.connection.url", "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hibernate_demo");
   configuration.setProperty("hibernate.connection.username", "root");
   configuration.setProperty("hibernate.connection.password", "Deeptavo@2708");
   configuration.setProperty("hibernate.dialect", "org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect");
   configuration.setProperty("hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto", "update");
   configuration.setProperty("hibernate.show_sql", "true");
   Explanation:
   These lines configure various Hibernate settings related to database connection and behavior:

hibernate.connection.driver_class: Specifies the JDBC driver to use (MySQL in this case).
hibernate.connection.url: The JDBC URL for the database.
hibernate.connection.username and hibernate.connection.password: Credentials for connecting to the database.
hibernate.dialect: Specifies the dialect Hibernate should use for MySQL. This tells Hibernate how to translate HQL (Hibernate Query Language) into SQL for the specific database.
hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto: Controls the automatic generation of database schemas (in this case, update means it will update the database schema based on your entity classes).
hibernate.show_sql: If set to true, Hibernate will log all SQL queries to the console for debugging purposes.
Why:
These settings are crucial for configuring Hibernate's connection to your database and for managing how Hibernate interacts with the database schema. The hibernate.dialect ensures Hibernate generates SQL optimized for MySQL. The hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto setting helps in automatically managing the schema during development (you can set it to create, update, or validate depending on your needs).

7. configuration.addAnnotatedClass(User.class);
   Explanation:
   This tells Hibernate to include the User class as an entity class. Annotations in the User class (like @Entity, @Table, etc.) will be used to map the class to a database table.
   Why:
   The addAnnotatedClass() method adds the User class (or any class annotated with Hibernate's JPA annotations) to the configuration, so Hibernate knows about it and can map it to a corresponding table in the database. Without this, Hibernate wouldn't know about your entities.
8. sessionFactory = configuration.buildSessionFactory();
   Explanation:
   This line builds the SessionFactory from the Configuration object. The SessionFactory is responsible for creating Session instances that interact with the database.
   Why:
   The SessionFactory is the central interface to interact with Hibernate. Once built, it can be used to open sessions, run queries, and manage transactions. It’s important to build it only once for efficiency (as it’s a costly object to create).
9. } catch (Throwable ex) {
   Explanation:
   This catch block handles any errors that occur during the configuration of Hibernate. Throwable is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in Java.
   Why:
   It's a good practice to catch all possible errors to ensure that you don't miss a configuration issue. By catching Throwable, you can handle errors more gracefully and avoid unexpected crashes in your application.
10. throw new ExceptionInInitializerError(ex);
    Explanation:
    If an error occurs during the initialization of the SessionFactory, the code throws an ExceptionInInitializerError, which is a runtime exception indicating that a static initializer has failed.
    Why:
    If Hibernate fails to initialize, you want to stop the application early (because the database layer isn’t set up correctly), so throwing an error is appropriate here. It helps you catch issues early during the startup process.
11. public static SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {
    Explanation:
    This defines a public static method getSessionFactory() that allows other parts of the application to retrieve the SessionFactory.
    Why:
    The SessionFactory is created only once (due to the static block), and this method provides a way to access that singleton instance across the application.
12. return sessionFactory;
    Explanation:
    This returns the SessionFactory instance.
    Why:
    This method simply returns the already initialized SessionFactory object so that other parts of the application can use it to interact with the database.
